# Road-Accident-Dashboard-Using-PowerBI
# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focused on analyzing road accidents data for the years 2021 and 2022. The main objective was to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into road accident trends, casualties, accident severity, vehicle types, and other relevant factors. This dashboard aims to help stakeholders gain a comprehensive understanding of road safety performance and identify areas that require attention and improvement.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Road accidents are a significant public safety concern, and understanding the patterns and contributing factors behind accidents is crucial for devising effective measures to reduce casualties and improve road safety. The problem addressed in this project was to analyze and visualize the road accident data to answer the following key questions:

Which vehicle types were involved in the highest number of accidents and casualties?

What were the trends in road accidents and casualties on a monthly basis?

How did the number of casualties vary across different road types?

What is the distribution of casualties based on accident severity?

How did the casualties differ between urban and rural areas and in different light conditions?

Which day of the week witnessed the highest and lowest number of accidents?

# DATA PROCESSING
To ensure the accuracy and usability of the road accidents data, several data transformation steps were performed:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values were identified and imputed.

Removing Duplicates: Duplicated records were removed to avoid inaccuracies in the analysis.

Data Modelling: The dataset was structured and modeled in a way that allowed for easy integration into the Power BI dashboard. Relevant data columns were selected and organized to support various visualizations.
